## 1. Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Organizations struggle to capture, evaluate, and prioritize innovative ideas from team members in a systematic way. Ideas are often lost in email threads, chat messages, or informal conversations, leading to missed opportunities for improvement and innovation. There is no centralized system to track ideas from conception through implementation.

### Why is this important?
- **Innovation Pipeline**: Teams need a structured way to collect and nurture innovative ideas
- **Resource Optimization**: Without proper evaluation, resources may be allocated to low-impact ideas
- **Engagement**: Team members feel undervalued when their ideas are lost or ignored
- **Competitive Advantage**: Companies that capture and act on ideas faster outpace competitors
- **Decision Support**: Leadership needs data-driven insights to prioritize innovation investments

### What happens if we don't solve this?
- Valuable ideas continue to be lost in informal channels
- Teams waste time re-proposing ideas that were previously rejected
- Innovation efforts lack structure and accountability
- Employee engagement in innovation decreases
- Competitors who have better idea management processes gain market advantage

## 6. User Flows

### Primary Flow: Idea Submission
**Trigger**: User wants to propose a new idea  
**Preconditions**: User is authenticated

**Steps**:
1. User clicks "Submit New Idea" button in navigation
2. System displays idea submission form
3. User fills in:
   - Title (required)
   - Description with rich text editor (required)
   - Category from dropdown (required)
   - Expected impact description (optional)
4. User optionally attaches files (up to 5 files, 10MB each)
5. System auto-saves draft every 30 seconds
6. User clicks "Submit Idea"
7. System validates inputs
8. System creates idea record with "Submitted" status
9. System sends confirmation email to user with idea ID
10. **Success State**: User sees confirmation message and is redirected to idea detail page

**Alternative Flows**:
- **7a. Validation fails**: System displays inline error messages, highlights invalid fields
- **8a. User saves as draft**: Idea saved with "Draft" status, not visible to reviewers yet
- **9a. Email service unavailable**: Idea still created, email queued for retry

### Secondary Flow: Idea Scoring & Approval
**Trigger**: Reviewer wants to evaluate a submitted idea  
**Preconditions**: User has Reviewer or Admin role, idea is in "Under Review" status

**Steps**:
1. Reviewer navigates to "Ideas for Review" queue
2. System displays list of ideas in "Under Review" status, sorted by submission date
3. Reviewer clicks on an idea to view details
4. System displays full idea details with scoring form
5. Reviewer scores each criterion:
   - Impact (1-5 scale)
   - Feasibility (1-5 scale)
   - Cost (Low/Med/High)
   - Strategic Alignment (1-5 scale)
6. System calculates weighted total score in real-time
7. Reviewer adds scoring justification (optional)
8. Reviewer changes status to "Approved" or "Rejected"
9. Reviewer adds status change comment (optional)
10. Reviewer clicks "Save & Update Status"
11. System saves scores and updates status
12. System sends notification to submitter
13. **Success State**: Idea moves to "Approved" or "Rejected" state, reviewer returns to review queue

**Alternative Flows**:
- **8a. Score is borderline**: Reviewer adds detailed justification, assigns to senior reviewer for second opinion
- **11a. Reviewer wants to save score without changing status**: System saves scores, status remains "Under Review"

## 10. Out of Scope

**Explicitly excluded from v1**:
- **Project Management Integration** - Deferred to Epic #TBD (Q2 2026)
  - Reason: Requires API contracts from PM tools, separate architecture needed
- **AI-Powered Idea Matching** - Deferred to Epic #TBD (Q3 2026)
  - Reason: Requires ML infrastructure, model training, separate team
- **Gamification System** - Deferred to Epic #TBD (Q4 2026)
  - Reason: Need v1 usage data to design effective rewards
- **Mobile Native Apps** - Deferred to Epic #TBD (2027)
  - Reason: Responsive web sufficient for v1, native requires separate development cycles
- **Multi-Language Support** - Not planned
  - Reason: Organization operates in English, i18n architecture complex
- **Idea Voting System** - Deferred to v1.1
  - Reason: Scoring by experts is sufficient initially, voting adds complexity
- **Advanced Reporting** - Deferred to v1.2
  - Reason: Basic analytics sufficient for launch, can add based on feedback

**Future Considerations**:
- **Slack/Teams Integration** - Revisit based on user feedback (Q2 2026)
- **Batch Idea Import** - If users need to migrate from spreadsheets (v1.1)
- **Custom Workflows** - If different departments need different processes (v2.0)

### Category Definitions
**Initial categories for launch** (configurable by admins):
1. **Product Innovation**: New features, capabilities, or product lines
2. **Process Improvement**: Workflow optimizations, efficiency gains
3. **Cost Reduction**: Ideas that lower operational expenses
4. **Customer Experience**: Improvements to customer satisfaction
5. **Employee Experience**: Improvements to workplace culture, tools
6. **Technology**: Infrastructure, tooling, technical debt
7. **Other**: Catch-all for uncategorized ideas

### Scoring Criteria Definitions
**Impact (1-5 scale)**:
- 1 = Minimal impact, affects < 10 people
- 2 = Low impact, affects 10-50 people
- 3 = Moderate impact, affects 50-200 people or 5-10% revenue
- 4 = High impact, affects 200-500 people or 10-25% revenue
- 5 = Transformational impact, affects 500+ people or 25%+ revenue

**Feasibility (1-5 scale)**:
- 1 = Very difficult, requires new tech/skills, > 6 months
- 2 = Difficult, significant engineering, 3-6 months
- 3 = Moderate, some new development, 1-3 months
- 4 = Easy, minor changes, 2-4 weeks
- 5 = Very easy, quick implementation, < 2 weeks

**Cost**:
- Low = < $10,000
- Medium = $10,000 - $50,000
- High = > $50,000

**Strategic Alignment (1-5 scale)**:
- 1 = Not aligned, conflicts with strategy
- 2 = Weakly aligned, tangential benefit
- 3 = Moderately aligned, supports 1 strategic pillar
- 4 = Highly aligned, supports 2+ strategic pillars
- 5 = Perfectly aligned, core to strategic objectives
