## Findings

### ✅ Approved Items

1. **Controller Design**: Clean REST API following conventions
2. **Dependency Injection**: Properly injected services
3. **Logging**: Appropriate log levels used
4. **Test Structure**: AAA pattern followed

### ⚠️ Minor Suggestions (Non-blocking)

1. **Consider FluentValidation**: For more complex validation scenarios
   ```csharp
   // Current: Model validation via attributes
   // Suggestion: FluentValidation for complex rules
   ```

2. **Add Cancellation Tokens**: For async operations
   ```csharp
   // Current
   public async Task<ActionResult<Feature>> GetById(int id)
   
   // Suggested
   public async Task<ActionResult<Feature>> GetById(int id, CancellationToken ct = default)
   ```

3. **Consider Result Pattern**: For cleaner error handling
   ```csharp
   // Consider using Result<T> pattern for service layer
   public Task<Result<Feature>> CreateAsync(CreateFeatureDto dto);
   ```
