# Contributing to AgentX

Thank you for contributing! This guide ensures all contributors follow the same workflow, **with or without GitHub Copilot**.

---

## 🎯 Core Workflow (Mandatory)

### The Issue-First Rule

**ALL work MUST start with a GitHub Issue created BEFORE you write any code.**

```
1. Create Issue → 2. Claim Issue → 3. Write Code → 4. Commit with Issue# → 5. Close Issue
```

**Why?** This ensures:
- Work is tracked and visible
- No duplicate efforts
- Clear audit trail
- Agent coordination works

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### First Time Setup

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jnPiyush/AgentX.git
cd AgentX

# Run setup script (installs pre-commit hooks)
.\install.ps1   # Windows
# OR
./install.sh    # Linux/Mac

# Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
# Windows: winget install GitHub.cli
# Mac: brew install gh
# Linux: See https://github.com/cli/cli#installation

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login
```

### For Every Task

```powershell
# 1. CREATE issue (choose the right template)
gh issue create --web
# OR use CLI:
gh issue create --title "[Type] Description" --label "type:story"

# 2. CLAIM the issue (move to 'In Progress' in Projects board)
# Use GitHub Projects UI to drag issue to 'In Progress' column

# 3. Create a branch
git checkout -b issue-<ISSUE#>-description

# 4. Make your changes
# (Code, test, document)

# 5. Commit with issue reference
git commit -m "type: description (#<ISSUE#>)"

# 6. Push and create PR
git push origin issue-<ISSUE#>-description
gh pr create --fill

# 7. After merge, close issue
gh issue close <ISSUE#> --comment "Completed in commit <SHA>"
```

## 📋 Issue Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Epic** | Large initiative, multiple features | "Build user authentication system" |
| **Feature** | New capability | "Add OAuth login" |
| **Story** | Small, specific task | "Add logout button" |
| **Bug** | Something broken | "Login page returns 500" |
| **Spike** | Research/investigation | "Evaluate PostgreSQL vs MongoDB" |
| **Docs** | Documentation only | "Update README with setup steps" |

### Creating Issues

**Via Web** (Easiest):
```powershell
gh issue create --web
```
This opens GitHub in your browser with structured templates.

**Via CLI** (Faster):
```powershell
# Story
gh issue create --title "[Story] Add logout button" --label "type:story"

# Bug
gh issue create --title "[Bug] Login returns 500" --label "type:bug,priority:p0"

# Feature (has UI work)
gh issue create --title "[Feature] Add OAuth login" --label "type:feature,needs:ux"
```

## 📝 Commit Message Format

```
type: description (#issue-number)

Optional longer explanation
```

### Types
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `test` - Adding/updating tests
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add OAuth login support (#123)"
git commit -m "fix: resolve 500 error on login page (#124)"
git commit -m "docs: update README with setup instructions (#125)"
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

**All code must have tests with ≥80% coverage**

```powershell
# Run tests
dotnet test                    # C#
pytest                         # Python
npm test                       # JavaScript

# Check coverage
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Pyramid
- 70% Unit tests (fast, isolated)
- 20% Integration tests (components working together)
- 10% E2E tests (full user flows)

## 🔒 Security Checklist

Before committing:
- [ ] No secrets/credentials in code
- [ ] Environment variables used for sensitive data
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterization (NEVER concatenation)
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities

```powershell
# Scan for secrets (pre-commit hook does this)
git diff --staged | grep -E '(password|api[_-]?key|secret|token)' -i

# Check dependencies
dotnet list package --vulnerable
pip-audit                      # Python
npm audit                      # Node.js
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T
- Start coding before creating an issue
- Create issues retroactively after work is done
- Commit without issue reference in message
- Push directly to `main`/`master`
- Hardcode secrets or sensitive data
- Skip tests
- Merge your own PRs without review

### ✅ DO
- Create issue FIRST, then code
- Use descriptive issue titles
- Reference issues in commits (#123)
- Create feature branches
- Use environment variables for config
- Write tests as you code
- Request reviews from teammates
